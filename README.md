## Conclusions from the ASD Project

I conducted an analysis comparing four different algorithms: Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. Each algorithm required a randomly generated array, with the data presented in the table below:

For each algorithm, the array was sorted and then reverse-sorted. The time required to sort each array was also measured, with the following results:

From this table, we can conclude that the fastest algorithm, with a speed of 200 [ns], is Insertion Sort. Below is a screenshot of the program's output for sorting the array:
